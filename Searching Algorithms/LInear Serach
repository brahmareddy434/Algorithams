Linear Searching ::
   It's a algorithm to Searching the elements in the object in continuous manner from starting index to end index.
   disadvantages::
      it taking more time for large data sets
      timecomplexity is O(N) so its takes more time for large data sets
    advantages
      Not required for the objects should be in ascending order
      good for small datasets
    ex:::

    package Collectionss;

public class LinearSearch {
	public String search(int[] arr, int target)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++) {
			
			if (arr[i] == target) {
				return "The searching ELement is available inside the array at the index "+ i;
			}
			
		}
		return "The Seraching Elemenkt is Not available inside the Array";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int a[] = {1,3,5,6,8};
		String ans = new LinearSearch().search(a, 8);
		System.out.println(ans);
	}

}
